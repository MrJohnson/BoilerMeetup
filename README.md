BoilerMeetup
  This is a Fall 2014 CS252 project.
  
  GOAL: 
  
  This app allows users to connect with others through events open to the community.
  Users can create events which others can find by the type of event, location, etc.
  Users can RSVP to events until the maximum capacity for the event is reached, unless no maximum is specified.
